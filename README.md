## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React. Players take turns as "X" and "O" to place their marks on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three in a row to win.

### Features
- **Two-Player Turn-Based Gameplay**: Each player (X and O) takes turns clicking on squares to place their mark.
- **Winner Highlight**: The winning row, column, or diagonal will be highlighted in green to celebrate the winner.
- **Game Reset**: Option to reset the game and start a new round.
- **Centered Layout**: The game board is positioned in the center of the screen for a clean, minimal look.
